# How much house can I afford

1. As a general rule, the mortgage (plus property taxes and insurance) should only be 30% of your monthly take home pay because the banks will be looking for this. Banks especially will not want no more than 44% of income going into mortgage payment.
2. You should aim for roughly spending 4x your salary on a house.

## Advice 

1. Save for closing costs: 3~6% of home price
2. Save for down payment: 15~20% of home price
3. Know your credit score
4. Houses appreciates due to the neighborhood and not so much the house itself
5. You first need to get qualified for a loan before shopping for a house. Leverage the power of the all-cash bid
