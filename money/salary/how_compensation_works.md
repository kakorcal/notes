# Compensation breakdown

Read the compensation package from the company thoroughly (you can also check this [site](https://www.levels.fyi/?compare=Google,Facebook,Microsoft&track=Software%20Engineer#contribute-home) to compare compensations between companies) to understand each of the following below:

## 1. Base Salary

A yearly base pay before taxes. Doesn't include benefits, bonuses or raises. Usually paid bi-weekly.

## 2. Equity

The percentage amount you own of the company. If the company is public (the general public is capable of owning the company), the equity is represented as a stock price in the stock market. For private companies, the value becomes apparent when the company gets acquired or goes through an IPO. The incentive is that if the stock price increases, your equity increases.

### 2.1 Types of Equity

  * RSU (restricted stock units) - Public companies will compensate with RSUs. These are stocks of the company that vests (earn) over a certain period of time (usually takes years to vest all the equity). Companies do this so that you don't have to pay taxes of the entire amount of stocks you own and it incentivises you to stay at the company longer. Example "$40k worth of RSUs over a 4 year vesting period with 1 year cliff". Cliff is the amount of time you must stay at the company in order to receive any equity. When a portion of your equity vests, you immediately pay income taxes (your company withholds some income to pay for the tax but make sure to double check). If you sell the vested stocks immediately there is no taxes, if sold within a year you pay short-term capital gain/loss taxes and if sold after a year you pay long-term capital gain/loss taxes.
  * Options - Private companies will compensate with options. This is the capability to buy a share at a discounted price (strike price). Example "10k stock options granted over 4 years". When the options vest, you can exercise (buy or sell option at strike price) the option. If the company issues more shares later on, it can dilute (the percentage amount you own is reduced) the existing options.

### 2.2 Equity calculation

Current valuation x (shares you own / shares outstanding) = equity

### 2.3 ESPP (Employee stock purchase plan) 

A program where you could set aside a percentage of your income towards purchasing your company stock at a fixed discounted price (usually 5~15%)

## 3. Bonuses
  
  * Annual - Lump-sum payment made once a year. Usually based on performance which ends up being 10~20% of base salary. This can increase as you stay longer in the company.
  * Sign on - Payment for new employees as incentive to join the company. Usually is not paid in lump-sum but gradually throughout the first year as a new employee. If you leave the company earlier you might have to pay back a certain amount.
  * Relocation - Lump-sum payment to help new employees move to the city where the office is.

## 4. Benefits
  
  * 401k
  * Time off (vacation, sick, volunteer, personal)
  * Health insurance
  * Health savings
  * Dental / vision insurance
  * Life insurance
  * Food, transportation, gym, etc
