# Equity in company overview

## What is equity?

Equity is the means to which you can own a part of the company -- usually the company offers shares of their stocks. 

## Stock options

The ability to buy ('exercise') shares of the company at a discounted ('strike') price in the future. So say that you had a stock option for 10k shares with a price of $1 per share. If the company's stock rises to $10 per share later on, you can exercise the 10k option by paying only the strike price of $10k (not $100k). You now own $100k in stocks with $90k in profit.

## Stock grants

Stock grants are payments in stocks -- usually they are in the form of RSUs (restricted stock units) which means you vest (earn) pieces of the total amount over a fixed period of time. 

## Liquidity

Liquidity is the term to describe how easy an asset can be converted into cash. Publicly traded companies have higher liquid equity -- this means if you have vested RSUs, you can sell shares you have for cash quickly. When you get an offer for liquid equity compensation, you can easily translate to an equivalent cash value.

Private companies have illiquid equity -- this means you don't have a simple way to convert your shares to cash until a liquidity event occurs (ie. the company IPOs or is bought by another company).

## Vesting and cliffs

Vesting schedule is a timeline in which you receive the option / grant stock in pieces. A vesting cliff is the minimum amount of time you need to work at a company in order to receive any type of equity compensation.

## Considerations for the job offer

Companies usually have wiggle room to increase equity compensation than the base salary. Understand that equity has more risks but more rewards.

## Equity refreshes

Equity refreshes are additional stock options/grants that you might receive later on in the company. These additional stocks have a vesting schedule of their own (usually there is no cliff though). So if you receive a sign-on grant of 1000 shares that vests in 4 years and a year later you receive 100 shares that vest in 4 years, it will take a total of 5 years to vest all of the shares. Usually vesting schedules are up to 4 years so after that it's possible that your total compensation goes down. That's way alot of employees leave to another company afterwards.

## Taxes

When granted stocks vest, the company can sell a portion of the vested shares immediately for tax withholding. Stock grants count as regular income so you need to report it. Since it counts as regular income, you might end up in a higher tax bracket. You can adjust your voluntary withholding so you don't have a massive bill when filing taxes. You also need to pay capital gains tax on the increased value of your stock when you sell it vs when it vested. There is a short and long term capital gains tax. Short term costs more so try to sell it a year after it vests to only pay long term tax. 

Summary strategy for selling:
1. Sell any shares that you’ve held for more than a year and will therefore be subject to long-term capital gains tax.
2. Sell shares that vested at a higher price than the current stock price, if any (you won’t have to pay any capital gains tax on this).
3. Sell either the shares that vested at the highest value or the most recently vested shares, depending somewhat on the specifics.
