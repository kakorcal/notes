[Goal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URES59zcNyg): Live off of investment profits without the need to work to earn money

## [4% rule](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/four-percent-rule.asp)

NOTE: 4% rule is a 'worst-case' / conservative rule if portfolio performance is bad. Realistically, 5% may be the number to use.

Withdraw only 4% of your portfolio each year in order to sustain quality of life and maintain steady income. The withdraw will only come from the interest / dividend earnings and not the principal. The 4% rule comes from a study from 1926 through 1976. The conclusion was that there was no cases where 4% annual withdrawal exhausted a retirement account in less than 33 years. 

To account for inflation, you could reinvest 2% back into the investment to ensure the 4% withdraw does not lose value each year. 2% is the target inflation rate of the Federal Reserve.


## Simplest strategy

1. Invest a ton of money
2. Live off interest income without touching the principal
3. Maintain an emergency fund
4. Save 50%~70% of paycheck or 30 times the annual expenses. These numbers allow to withdrawal 4% per year
5. Invest in low fee index funds passively. VOO Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (Buys a small piece of the 500 largest public companies. The dividends from each are combined and paid to you quarterly). You could expect a 8%~10% return per year. This means you should never withdrawal more than 8% so that the principal remains and keeps generating consistent income.

## Case study

Salary: $75k annually
No debt / car / medical payments except for house
Take home pay after tax: $56250
Left expenses: $16875 per year or $1406.25 per month 
Allocate rest of 70%: Emergency, investment
If expenses maintain the freedom number will be: $506250

If you invested all $39375 every year into an index fund and expected a 8% return each year: You will reach the $570408.40 in 10 years


## How much money needs to be invested

| Annual expenses | Amount invested |
| $20k | $600k |
| $35k | $1.05M |
| $50k | $1.5M |
| $100k | $3M |

For every $100/month you spend, you need to have $36k invested
For every $5000/month you spend, you need to have $1.8M invested

This article also reconsiders the 4% rule as it might not be enough for today's time and that 0.5% might be better. For example, a $1 million investment with 4% withdrawal means $40k per year. That might not be enough for your situation.
