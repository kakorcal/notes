## Evaluate last year's status

To get a sense of what to expect, plan, and exceed for the current year, understand last year's net worth, income and expenses.

* Net worth: assets - liabilities = net worth  
* Income: After tax earnings. Check W-2 and IRAs 
* Expenses: Go through your bank statements and check for reoccurring expenses that you don't need

## Set goals

Set short (1 year) and long (5~10 years) term goals. Each goal should be very specific (ie. 'Save x amount by x date so that I can do x'). The short term goals should be a bit size goal of your long term goal.

## Create this year's plan

Create a budget sheet. [Example 1](https://2022pf.notion.site/2022pf/2022-Financial-Plan-TEMPLATE-9adda2b92a494b44998e6fae90498a21) [Example 2](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zgf_tSKynm2ATgWsMvH_DieIfTKkGRwFf_JDvs7Thb8/edit#gid=0)
