# Fidelity Index Funds

## What is an index fund?

Index fund is a pool of multiple company shares that determines the asset allocations using an index (S&P 500, Dow Jones, NASDAQ). An index is typically tracks the top companies in the current market. It is passively managed by algorithms rather than fund managers so there is less fees for you to pay.

## How to choose an index fund to invest in

1. Expense ratio - An annual fee for investing in the fund. Look for an expense ratio that is below 0.20%. For example, if you invest $1000 in FSKAX (Total market index fund), you will pay $0.15 annually. 
2. Automatic dividend reinvestment - When investing in stocks, you are awarded dividend payments monthly or quarterly. We could use the earned money to reinvest it back into the stock market. We could set this system up automatically when you buy mutual fund index funds (not ETFs). This is also referred to as the strategy of [compound interest](http://www.helpfulcalculators.com/compound-interest-calculator)
3. Transaction fees - The fee for buying or selling the index fund. Some funds have this fee. If you buy or sell Fidelity index funds through Fidelity, there is no transaction fees. In short, just buy or sell funds that are made by the brokerage company you have an account with to avoid this fee.
