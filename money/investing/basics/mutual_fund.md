# Mutual Fund

## No load fund

A fund you buy directly from a company (like Vanguard or Fidelity) and not through a broker. They don't charge a commission but they will charge a maintenance fee (expense ratio).

## Front load fund

A fund that you buy from a broker. They charge an upfront fee initially but usually will have a smaller maintenance fee. This may seem like no load funds are better but it depends on how much the maintenence fee cost over time.
