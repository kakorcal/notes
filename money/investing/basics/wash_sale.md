# Wash sale

Don't buy a stock 30 days before or after selling a similar stock at a loss. 

# How to prevent

1. Set a limit order that is above the cost-basis (ie. do not set it at the same price because the SEC assessment fee will lower the sale price) and day to GTC (good till cancelled). If you are unable to sell before the trading window closes, make sure to cancel the order since GTC will last 180 days.
2. If the limit order does not go through, you need to wait 31 days after you bought the stock before you could sell it. Just make sure you are still within the trading window.
