# Ingredients

1. Ribeye steak (1 inch thickness)
2. Garlic (1 clove)
3. Butter (2 tbsp)
4. Salt, Pepper, Garlic powder, Onion powder
5. Rosemary

# Cooking

1. Season ribeye with salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder. Leave it for an hour so that the steak reaches room temperature
2. Heat the pan to be very hot. If a water droplet evaporates when touching the pan, that's a good sign to put the steak in.
3. Add canola oil. Wait for 30 seconds then add the steak.
4. Press down with a spatula for 10 seconds. Then cook each side for 2 minutes
5. Use a tong to cook the fatty sides so that they render down. 30 seconds to 1 minute
6. Put heat to low. Add butter, garlic and rosemary. Baste the steak for 30 seconds to 1 minute
7. Take the steak out and let it rest for 5~6 minutes. We should have a medium rare cook (125 F ~ 135 F)
